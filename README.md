# TTProject4

This project is taking a look at some car data from the vehicles_us.csv file. With that we are going to make 2 histograms and 1 scatterplot. We are going to create a histogram that compares the type of car and what color it is, another one that displays what kind of cylinders each model of car has. The scatterplot shows the model year and how much the odometer has. Youj can also see which brand of cars that each of the points are as well.
